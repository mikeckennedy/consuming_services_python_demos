00:02 The first thing you are going to need to take this course is Python of course,
00:05 and I am sure many of you are happy to hear it's Python 3, not Python 2, 
00:10 and you might as well use Python 3.6 
00:13 but if you have 3.5 or something like that installed, that's totally good, 
00:16 if you are on Windows, there is a good chance 
00:20 you have no version of Python and you'll need to install Python 3; 
00:23 if you are on OS 10 or macOS as it's called these days,
00:26 you probably have Python 2 which ships with it, but not Python 3. 
00:30 If you are on Ubuntu, chances are that both Python 2 and Python 3 are there, 
00:34 so check your system, see what it is that you need, 
00:37 but we are using Python 3 and we are not using either of the 3.6 features, 
00:41 so if you have 3.5 or 3.4 that's totally fine. 
00:43 Now, there is a very small segment where we do talk about using Python 2 
00:47 because the way the built-ins work in Python 2 and Python 3 are different, 
00:50 so we do touch on Python 2 just for a moment, 
00:53 if you are on Windows, you are going to need to install that as well, 
00:56 but only if you want to do that little piece, you don't technically have to do it. 
01:00 Some of you may be thinking 'Oh should we do this on 3? Should we do it on 2?',
01:03 I think the debate about Python 3 and Python 2 is pretty much at the end. 
01:07 If you look at the last several PyCon keynotes done by Guido Van Rossum 
01:12 he always opens up with 'There is going to be no new versions of Python 2, 
01:16 no Python 2.8.' 
01:19 So I think certainly going forward Python 3 is the place where it's at, 
01:23 that said, the actual differences except for the built-in sections are extremely small, 
01:27 so really, it's either way will work but the code we are writing is technically Python 3 
01:32 so you want to have that installed.
