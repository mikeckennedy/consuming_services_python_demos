00:01 To create a post we do an HTTP POST. One is blog post. One is a verb, 
00:08 an HTTP POST against the general blog collection.
00:11 So we do an HTTP POST against api/blog and the body of that POST is a JSON document
00:17 containing all the details we want to use as part of that post creation, 
00:21 the title, the content, things like that. 
00:24 Then what comes back is the actual thing that the server created, 
00:28 so it inserted into the database, which generated things 
00:30 like the id and other potential values 
00:34 and it sent that back for us to continue to work with in our application. 
00:37 Now, throughout the rest of these concepts in this chapter, 
00:41 we are going to assume that we have always written import requests 
00:45 and that the base_url is that public URL of our service  
00:49 http://consumer_services_api.talkpython.fm
00:52 that will mean we just have a little less to look at at each of the detailed steps. 
00:57 Okay, to create a new post, in code, what we are going to do is 
01:00 we are going to create a new_post dictionary and set the values 
01:03 that we have control over, title, content, view count and published. 
01:07 Remember, there is also id but that is server generated 
01:10 so there is no point in passing it or trying to come up with one 
01:13 because it's just going to be created by the database anyway,
01:15 then we set the URL to be the base_url + '/api/blog', 
01:19 not a particular id, just the general collection, and then we are going to do 
01:22 an HTTP POST to that URL and the body is going to be the dictionary, 
01:27 we say the JSON objects, the dictionary is going to be converted to JSON. 
01:31 Now, one note is I actually, in my code when I did the demos, 
01:35 I set the headers and set the body type, where the content type is JSON.
01:40 Actually if we set the JSON property request knows that that has to be the case 
01:44 and it's going to set it for us so we can skip that header step it turns out. 
01:48 Now, when we are done, we better check the response code, 
01:51 the standard response code for some sort of post like this is 201 created, 
01:55 so if it's not 201 that's a problem, but if it is, we can just access the data 
02:00 by calling .json convert our server side post 
02:05 into just a simple Python dictionary and we're off to the races.
